# fetch_wattwatcher

A utility for downloading Wattwatcher data and uploading it to other
systems.

This is a work in progress.  Currently the program logic and process is
changing rapidly.  It's changing from a very simple program to do just
what I want to a more general program that can accommodate a variety of
uses.

# Installation

`$ pipenv install`
